# Style Guidelines

## General Rules

*  Do not create components that inhabit the main graph visualizer div, instead add to existing toolbars or make draggable modals
*  Try not to use custom colors if at all posible
*  Try to make labels descriptive and somewhat concise

## Pre-made Components
* Use only pre made components from the vuetify library
* If something you need is not in vuetify ask a project lead what to do

## CSS Guidelines

* Preferably use inline css overrides compared to the style section of your component
* However if you are repeatedly overriding the same CSS property for the same class use the style section
